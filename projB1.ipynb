No late submissions beyond what is outlined in the Slip Day policy will be accepted. We strongly encourage you to plan to submit your work to Gradescope several hours before the stated deadline. This way, you will have ample time to reach out to staff for support if you encounter difficulties with submission. While course staff is happy to help guide you with submitting your assignment ahead of the deadline, we will not respond to last-minute requests for assistance (TAs need to sleep, after all!).\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "You will use what you've learned in class to create a binary classifier that can distinguish spam (junk, commercial, or bulk) emails from ham (regular non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data.\n",
    "- Using the `sklearn` library to process data and fit models.\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the project focuses on initial analysis, feature engineering, and logistic regression. In the second part of this project (which will be released next week), you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Warning\n",
    "This is a **real-world** dataset —— the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these inappropriate emails but wanted to provide a warning at the beginning of the project so that you are aware.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `words_in_texts` function should output a **2-dimensional `NumPy` array** that contains one row for each email in `texts` and one column for each word in `words`. If the $j$-th word in `words` is present at least once in the $i$-th email in `texts`, the output array should have a value of 1 at the position $(i, j)$. Otherwise, if the $j$-th word is not present in the $i$-th email, the value at $(i, j)$ should be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Project B2, we will be applying `words_in_texts` to some large datasets, so implementing some form of vectorization (for example, using `NumPy` arrays, `Series.str` functions, etc.) is highly recommended. **You are allowed to use only *one* list comprehension or for loop**, and you should look into how you could combine that with the vectorized functions discussed above. **Do not use a double for loop, or you will run into issues later on in Project B2.**\n",
    "\n",

    "       [1, 0, 1]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, we **do not** calculate the *number of occurrences* of each word; only if the word is present at least *once*. Take a moment to work through the example on your own if need be —— understanding what the function does is a critical first step in implementing it.\n",

First, we are evaluating the accuracy of the model on the training set, which may be a misleading measure. Accuracy on the training set doesn't always translate to accuracy in the real world (on the test set). In future parts of this analysis, we will make use of the data we held out for model validation and comparison.\n",

    "- **False negative (FN)**: A spam email gets mislabeled as ham and ends up in the inbox.\n",

    "To be clear, we label spam emails as 1 and ham emails as 0. These definitions depend both on the true labels and the predicted labels.

As a result, if the model predicted 0 for all 7513 values, then 1918 would be incorrectly classfied as ham (negative) when it was truly spam (positive) meaning that these are false negatives. zero_predictor_acc could be found by taking the number of correct predictions, which was 5595, since there are 5595 true negatives and the model predicts all negatives, divided by 7513, since there are 7513 emails in total.
